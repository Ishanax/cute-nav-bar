    <br>
    <p>I have been teaching myself to code this year and feel front end web development suit my skills, personality traits and interests te best. So far Iâ€™ve completed courses in introductory Python and SQLite. I found this somewat to 'dry' after some exploring I moved on to front-end web development applications such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I can express my creativity best in front end. While this gave me a good overview of software development, I am certainly still eager to learn more.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Furthermore, during my Philosophy masters degree, I enjoyed honing my critical and analytical skills, which I imagine will be indispensable in this job. The other aspect that I look for in a job is the opportunity to work with people from a wide variety of backgrounds, something I have had experience with whilst working at a human rights organization in South Africa. I have always felt that my professional life should involve rich interaction with others, so I was glad to see that this would be an important part of the job. Although my German is not yet fluent, I can already read and understand at an intermediate level. My native language is Dutch, so I feel confident I will pick it up quickly.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In conclusion, I think that my past experience, education and skills have prepared me well to contribute meaningfully to your organization. </p>
